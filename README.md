# hello-world
I've done a bit of writing code over the years, but always managed to lose it when a computer crashed or I decided to wipe out the operating system.
This time around I am now utilizing AI to speed things up, since it's so tedious to write boilerplate code for projects. 
I've made a promise to myself that I will never implement anything generated by AI unless I fully understand the code and can somehow
use it to make something even better, or even refactor something.  AI isn't perfect.  

Just thought I'd add that I'm not really nervous about my interview tomorrow because, other than new software, I've pretty familiar with logistics.
