# hello-world
I've done a bit of writing code over the years, but always managed to lose it when a computer crashed or I decided to wipe out the operating system.
This time around I am now utilizing AI to speed things up, since it's so tedious to write boilerplate code for projects. 
I've made a promise to myself that I will never implement anything generated by AI unless I fully understand the code and can somehow
use it to make something even better, or even refactor something.  AI isn't perfect.
